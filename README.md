## Project Proposal

We assume we will have a description of requirements associated with the possibility of expressing
a candidacy for a job position according to the ELMO model (https://github.com/emrex-eu/elmoschemas). The requirements that can be expressed using the ELMO schemas are limited to
academic results, we are aware of this limitation, but we consider it acceptable for the scope of the
current project.

We assume that a user interested in expressing a candidacy for a given job position has a personal
digital wallet such as the one developed by EUDI (https://github.com/eu-digital-identitywallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/README.md)
The main goal of this project is to develop a service that is capable of generating a set of constraints
expressed according to the ELMO framework and of transforming that set of constraints into a
request for a Verifiable Presentation usable with the EUDI wallet either to generate a Verifiable
Presentation capable of proving the fact that the owner of the wallet satisfies the given constraints
or to notify the user of the impossibility to satisfy the constraints because of some missing
Verifiable Credential.

The way the request is presented to the wallet has to adhere to the “OpenID for Verifiable
Presentations” standard (https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html).
Similarly, the format for the Verifiable Presentation generated by the wallet has to follow OID4VP
standard.

## Credential types:
const credentialTypes = {

  'UniversityDegree': ['name', 'degreeType', 'university', 'graduationDate'],
  
  'DriverLicense': ['name', 'licenseNumber', 'issueDate', 'expiryDate'],
  
  'PID': ['name', 'idNumber', 'dateOfBirth', 'address'],
  
  'ResidenceCertificate': ['name', 'address', 'issueDate', 'validUntil']

};

## How to run 
TO run the frontend the command is:

npm start

To run the backend the command is:

node server.js
